## Introduction to Lasso Regression

### What is Lasso Regression?

Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a linear regression technique that uses L1 regularization to penalize the absolute value of coefficients. This results in sparse models where some coefficients can become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. Lasso is widely used when you have many features and want to identify the most important ones.

### Key Concepts

- **L1 Regularization**: Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.
- **Feature Selection**: Lasso can shrink some coefficients to zero, removing irrelevant features.
- **Sparsity**: The resulting model is often simpler and more interpretable.
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Regularization helps prevent overfitting, especially with high-dimensional data.

### When to Use Lasso Regression

- **High-dimensional datasets**: Many features, some of which may be irrelevant.
- **Automatic feature selection**: Need to identify and keep only the most important predictors.
- **Preventing overfitting**: When linear regression overfits due to too many features.
- **Interpretability**: When a sparse, easy-to-interpret model is desired.

### Advantages and Limitations

#### Advantages

- **Performs feature selection**: Coefficients can be exactly zero.
- **Reduces model complexity**: Leads to simpler, more interpretable models.
- **Helps with multicollinearity**: Can select one among correlated features.
- **Prevents overfitting**: Regularization term discourages large coefficients.

#### Limitations

- **Can be unstable**: If features are highly correlated, Lasso may arbitrarily select one.
- **Bias in coefficients**: Shrinks all coefficients, introducing bias.
- **Not suitable for all problems**: If all features are relevant, Ridge or Elastic Net may be better.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Lasso Regression Objective

For a dataset with features $X$ and target $y$, Lasso solves:

$$
\min_{\beta_0, \beta} \left\{ \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - X_i \cdot \beta)^2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j| \right\}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$: Regularization strength (higher = more regularization)
- $\beta_0$: Intercept
- $\beta$: Coefficient vector
- $|\beta_j|$: Absolute value of coefficient $j$

### Geometric Interpretation

- The L1 penalty constrains the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.
- The constraint region is a diamond (in 2D), which encourages solutions on the axes (i.e., some coefficients exactly zero).

### Comparison to Ridge Regression

- **Ridge**: L2 penalty (squared coefficients), shrinks coefficients but rarely to zero.
- **Lasso**: L1 penalty, can shrink coefficients to zero (feature selection).
- **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 penalties.

## Lasso vs. Other Regression Methods

| Method         | Regularization | Feature Selection | Use Case                  |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Linear        | None          | No                | Baseline, simple problems |
| Ridge         | L2            | No                | Many small/medium effects |
| Lasso         | L1            | Yes               | Sparse, high-dim data     |
| Elastic Net   | L1 + L2       | Yes               | Correlated features       |

## Implementation in Python

### Basic Lasso Regression

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
coef = np.array([1.5, -2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0])
y = X @ coef + np.random.randn(100) * 0.5

# Fit Lasso regression
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X, y)

print("Lasso coefficients:", lasso.coef_)
print("Number of non-zero coefficients:", np.sum(lasso.coef_ != 0))
```

### Lasso Path and Feature Selection

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import lasso_path

alphas, coefs, _ = lasso_path(X, y, alphas=np.logspace(-2, 1, 100))

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
for i in range(coefs.shape[0]):
    plt.plot(alphas, coefs[i], label=f'Feature {i}')
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Alpha')
plt.ylabel('Coefficient value')
plt.title('Lasso Paths')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Lasso with Cross-Validation

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV

lasso_cv = LassoCV(cv=5, random_state=42)
lasso_cv.fit(X, y)

print(f"Optimal alpha: {lasso_cv.alpha_:.4f}")
print(f"Lasso R² score: {lasso_cv.score(X, y):.4f}")
```

## Model Evaluation

### Regression Metrics

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

lasso = Lasso(alpha=lasso_cv.alpha_)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = lasso.predict(X_test)

print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("R²:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Cross-Validation

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

cv_scores = cross_val_score(lasso, X, y, cv=5, scoring='r2')
print(f"Cross-validation R² scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean CV R²: {cv_scores.mean():.4f} (+/- {cv_scores.std() * 2:.4f})")
```

## Feature Selection and Interpretation

### Feature Importance

- Lasso automatically selects features by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
- The magnitude of non-zero coefficients indicates feature importance.

```python
feature_names = [f'Feature_{i}' for i in range(X.shape[1])]
selected_features = [name for name, coef in zip(feature_names, lasso.coef_) if coef != 0]
print("Selected features:", selected_features)
```

### Visualizing Feature Selection

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.bar(feature_names, lasso.coef_)
plt.xlabel('Feature')
plt.ylabel('Coefficient')
plt.title('Lasso Feature Coefficients')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

## Assumptions and Diagnostics

### Lasso Regression Assumptions

- **Linearity**: Relationship between features and target is linear.
- **Independence**: Observations are independent.
- **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals.
- **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed (for inference).
- **No or little multicollinearity**: Lasso can help, but highly correlated features may cause instability.

### Residual Analysis

```python
y_train_pred = lasso.predict(X_train)
y_test_pred = lasso.predict(X_test)
residuals = y_test - y_test_pred

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.scatter(y_test_pred, residuals)
plt.axhline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.title('Residuals vs Predicted (Lasso)')
plt.show()
```

## Advanced Topics

### Lasso for High-Dimensional Data

- Lasso is especially useful when the number of features $p$ is much larger than the number of samples $n$.
- It can select a small subset of relevant features, improving interpretability and generalization.

### Lasso with Pipelines

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('lasso', Lasso(alpha=0.1))
])
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Elastic Net

- Combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.
- Useful when features are highly correlated.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNetCV

elastic_cv = ElasticNetCV(cv=5, random_state=42)
elastic_cv.fit(X, y)
print(f"Optimal alpha: {elastic_cv.alpha_:.4f}")
print(f"Optimal l1_ratio: {elastic_cv.l1_ratio_:.4f}")
```

## Best Practices

- **Standardize features**: Lasso is sensitive to feature scaling.
- **Tune alpha**: Use cross-validation to find the optimal regularization strength.
- **Check feature correlations**: Highly correlated features can cause instability.
- **Interpret with care**: Zero coefficients mean exclusion, but non-zero does not always mean importance.
- **Combine with domain knowledge**: Use Lasso as a tool, not a replacement for understanding your data.

## Real-World Applications

### Genomics and Bioinformatics
- Selecting relevant genes from thousands of candidates.

### Finance
- Identifying key economic indicators for forecasting.

### Marketing
- Selecting the most influential factors for sales prediction.

### Text Mining
- Feature selection in high-dimensional text data (e.g., bag-of-words models).
